# 2020-CSSI-JS-Covid-19-Map-as-of-July-2020

This is the final project I completed for the Google-Sponsored Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI). I collaborated with one other team member: Sarah Luna. 

We used the p5 JavaScript library to build a map that displays the amount of COVID-19 cases in the United States and all the countries who have published such data. There are no numerical values displayed but circles and their size are used to convey the magnitude of spread in each region, using inspiration from Daniel Shiffman's earthquake visualization map. The data used is static data that was acquired from the CDC in July of 2020.
