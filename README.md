# 2020-CSSI-JS-Covid-19-Map-as-of-July-2020

This is the final project I completed for the Google-Sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with one other team member: Sarah Luna. 

We used the p5 javascript library to build a map that displays the amount of case of COVID-19 in the United States and all the countries who have published such data. There is no numberical values but circles and size used to convey the magnitude of spread in each region, using inspiration from Daniel Shiffman's earthquake visualization map. The data used is static data that was aquired from the CDC in July of 2020.
